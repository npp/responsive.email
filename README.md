# NPP Responsive Email Template

This template is based on work from Zurb.  You can see it here:

* http://zurb.com/ink/docs.php

Zurb also has a second set of templates.  I'm sharing that template set link specifically because of some of the notes they have regarding the use of the templates (which I believe also apply to the Ink template set).

Of particular note is the section regarding bringing CSS inline:

> All CSS needs to be inline for HTML emails. For ease of editing, we've kept the CSS separate. When you're ready to send your email, you'll want to use a CSS inliner tool, such as MailChimp's or Premailer, among others. Many email campaign tools such as Campaign Monitor will do this for you automatically.

Hopefully Constant Contact will take care of this step for us.  If not, we'll need to handle this ourselves.  Here are some useful links regarding that process:
